## Motivation and differences

I forked and upgraded the discord-ext-ipc library to now work with discord.py v2 or higher. The primary reason why is that most of the "IPC" libraries out there are slow and I desperately needed a better IPC library for myself. The core has been kept almost intact, but here are some the changes worth noting:

- The `start` method is now an coroutine and needs to be awaited.
- Actually type hinting the library

More in the future may be added or deleted.
